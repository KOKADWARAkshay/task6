# Car Insurance Sales Data Analysis


## Introduction
Assume you are a data scientist at a local bank. In addition to standard banking services, your bank offers car insurance. The bank has information on potential customers, and bank employees contact them to advertise available car insurance options.
You are given general information about clients (age, job, etc.) as well as more specific information about the current insurance sell campaign (communication, last contact day) and previous campaign (communication, last contact day) (attributes like previous attempts,outcome etc).
You have information on 3100 customers who were contacted during the previous campaign and whose campaign results (whether the customer purchased insurance or not) are known.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by the bank contains the following fields:

Age: The age of the customer
Job: The type of job the customer has
Marital: The marital status of the customer
Education: The level of education of the customer
Default: Whether the customer has defaulted on any loans
Balance: The current balance in the customer's account
Housing: Whether the customer has a housing loan
Loan: Whether the customer has a personal loan
Contact: The method of communication used to contact the customer
Day: The day of the month when the customer was last contacted
Month: The month of the year when the customer was last contacted
Duration: The duration of the last contact with the customer
Campaign: The number of contacts made during this campaign
Pdays: The number of days since the customer was last contacted (0 means the customer was not contacted previously)
Previous: The number of contacts made with the customer in previous campaigns
Poutcome: The outcome of the previous marketing campaign
Y: Whether the customer has purchased car insurance (our target variable)
Tools
## Tools and libraries  
Python

Google Colab

Excel

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn 

Exploration


The analysis code was written in Python and used several libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The dataset was initially explored in Excel and analyzed in both PyCharm and Google Colab.
## Analysis

The analysis consists of several steps:

Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution, correlation, and relationship between the variables using visualizations and statistical techniques.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on the existing variables to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Building: Creating a predictive model using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict whether a customer will purchase car insurance or not.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Interpretation: Interpreting the model results and understanding which variables have the most impact on the prediction.
## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into the factors that influence a customer's decision to purchase car insurance. By using machine learning algorithms, we can predict which customers are more likely to purchase insurance and focus our marketing efforts on those customers. This can help the bank to increase its revenue and provide better services to its customers.
## Future Work

Further analysis can be done to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. This can be achieved by using more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines, or by optimizing the parameters of the existing models. Additionally, the analysis can be extended to include more variables such as the customer's credit score or the type of car they own, which can provide more insights into the customer's behavior.

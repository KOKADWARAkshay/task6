Problem Statement

Imagine you are a data scientist at a bank in your city. Your bank besides usual services also provides car insurance services. The bank has potential customers data and bank employees call them for advertising available car insurance options.

 

You are provided with general information about clients (age,job,etc.) as well as more specific information about the current insurance sell campaign (communication,last contact day) and previous campaign (attributes like previous attempts,outcome etc).

 

You have data about 3100 customers who were contacted during the last campaign and for whom the results of the campaign (if the customer bought insurance or not) are known.
